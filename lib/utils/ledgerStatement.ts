// The arithmetic behind the Ledger page and a party's statement, kept free of
// React so it can be checked on its own.
//
// A party has two ledgers (customer_ledger_entries and vendor_ledger_entries,
// opposite polarity - see 0059_vendor_ledger.sql). A statement shows them as ONE
// account from the business's side, the way a debtors' ledger does:
//   Debit  = the party owes you more
//   Credit = the party owes you less
//   Balance = Debit - Credit; positive = they owe you (Receivable), negative =
//   you owe them (Payable).
// So a sale and a payment you made out are Debits; money you received and a
// purchase on credit are Credits. That is exactly the figure partyPosition()
// already netted (customer balance - vendor balance), just with its two halves
// shown.
