 *
 * "Available" is money you can actually spend, so it is never negative: an
 * account whose books have gone below zero (more recorded going out than coming
 * in) reads 0 here. The books themselves - the Day Book, Bank Balances and the
 * dashboard - still show the true figure.
 *
 * Pass the user id only where the amounts are wanted; with `undefined` nothing
 * is read at all. Returns null until the books have loaded, so a dropdown never
 * shows zeros that look like real balances. */
